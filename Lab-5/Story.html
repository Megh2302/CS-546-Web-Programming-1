			<p>Three years ago, I wanted laptop and mobile phone for my work. But for some reason, I was not able to buy. At that time I waited for three to four months for buying phone and laptop. After that I decided that I would purchase both on my Birthday and before one day of my Birthday, I bought both. On my Birthday, my sister sent surprise gift for me. When I opened the box, It was same Mobile and Laptop in that box as I bought a day before. First, I really shocked but as I am a huge fan of Electronic Gadgets, It became an Excitement for me.</p>
